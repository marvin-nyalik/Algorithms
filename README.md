# Algorithms 
### Demystifying the mystery of Computer Science 
- This repo contains major algorithms for coding interviews

- Every branch is dedicated to only one Algorithm

- The entry function for all algorithms is a function `entryPoint()` - View the context
of the function to determine how to use the code

`Good Luck && Happy Coding`

# CONCEPT #1 - RECURSION

Recursion in computer science is a method where `the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem`.

# Examples of recursive problems & Solutions:
- The factorial function - **Go to factorial.js**
  The factorial of a number n, is by definition, `the number n` multiplied by the factorial of `n - 1`

  Meaning: 
  `factorial(n) = n * factorial(n - 1)`


- The fibonacci sequence **Go to fibonacci.js**
  The fibonacci value of a number n is the sum of the fibonacci value of the previous two numbers in the sequence

  Meaning:
  `fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci (n - 2)`

- The recursive sums problem **Go to sums.js**

- [ ] Having this basic idea, let's checkout some examples of the recursion problem.

- [ ] The recurive problems and solutions will be continously updated. 

- [ ] Open an issue to suggest a solution you'd like to see in this repo
