# Algorithms 
### Demystifying the mystery of Computer Science 
- This repo contains major algorithms for coding interviews

- Every branch is dedicated to only one Algorithm

- The entry function for all algorithms is a function `entryPoint()` - View the context
of the function to determine how to use the code

`Good Luck && Happy Coding`

`The question of efficiency of algorithms is like the question of a favorite child, we know its there and that we love it, we just don't admit that it's important for all projects`
