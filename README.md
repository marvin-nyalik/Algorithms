# Algorithms - Recursion

Recursion in computer science is a method where `the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem`.

# Examples of recursive problems:
- The factorial function
  The factorial of a number n, is by definition, `the number n` multiplied by the factorial of `n - 1`

  Meaning: 
  `factorial(n) = n * factorial(n - 1)`

- The fibonacci sequence
  The fibonacci value of a number n is the sum of the fibonacci value of the previous two numbers in the sequence

  Meaning:
  `fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci (n - 2)`
